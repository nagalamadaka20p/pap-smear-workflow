            HPV or human papillomavirus is a virus that the majority of people

              GARDASIL 9 helps protect individuals ages 9 to 45 against the
              following diseases caused by 9 types of HPV: cervical, vaginal,
              and vulvar cancers in females, anal cancer, certain head and neck
              cancers, such as throat and back of mouth cancers and genital
              warts in both males and females.
            </p>
            <p>
              GARDASIL 9 may not fully protect everyone, nor will it protect
              against diseases caused by other HPV types or against diseases not
              caused by HPV. GARDASIL 9 does not prevent all types of cervical,
              vulvar, vaginal, anal, or head and neck cancers.

            <p>
              Vaccination does not remove the need for recommended cancer
              screenings, and it's important to get routine cervical cancer
              screenings. GARDASIL 9 does not treat HPV infection, cancer, or
              genital warts.

                For persons 9 through 14 years of age, GARDASIL 9 can be given
                using a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule. For the 2-dose schedule, the
                second shot should be given 6-12 months after the first shot. If
                the second shot is given less than 5 months after the first
                shot, a third shot should be given at least 4 months after the
                second shot. For the 3-dose schedule, the second shot should be
                given 2 months after the first shot and the third shot should be
                given 6 months after the first shot.

            When there are cervical cells that look abnormal but are not yet
            cancerous, it is called <i>cervical precancer</i>. These abnormal
            cells may be the first sign of cancer that develops years later.
            Cervical precancer usually doesn't cause pain or other symptoms. It
            is found with a Pap test. Click{" "}
